        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          <div style="margin:50px;">
          Ben Kartchner has always been fascinated with computers and how they work.
           For as long as he can remember he has been using them to play games and mess around
           and do cool stuff. However, despite this infatuation with technology, Ben was confused for a long time
           on what he wanted to major in. He initally thought of studying Mechnical Engineering because he liked math and
           physics, but while on his mission he connected with his inner child and decided to pursue an Animation degree
           from BYU, with a minor in CS. After taking the intro to programming class, Ben connected further with his inner
           child and realized this is what he needed to do. Ben is currently trying to get into the CS Animation program
           at BYU, but if he doesn't get in he will continue on studying in the CS field. He is especially excited for this
           web programming class and all of the cool skills he will acquire while being in it.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          Besides exploring the wonderful world of computers and learning to program, Ben likes to spend his free time messing around
          in Unity making crappy games, pretending to know how to 3D model, stream on twitch, and has recently been getting into DJing and house music.
          Other hobbies he has, that don't involve a computer so are therfore inferior, include skiing, longboarding, playing spikeball, and starting this winter, snowboarding, but very badly.
